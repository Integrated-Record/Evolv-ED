## History and Rationale

This website is born from a blog by Nussaibah R. Schoob and Adam T. Kocsis, which was put inplace in 2019 to help illustrate the use of some tools (R packages) that were developed at [paleontology institute](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/palaeontologie/) of the [University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu/). 

Over the past 5 years of working with the practical education of coding examples, a number of issues regarding changes of software implementations surfaced, including major version changes in platforms and frameworks  

After multiple iterations of implementation, the project is still in development, with a more explicit focus: to teach researchers about the possible implementation of quantatitave methods and help with the integration of the global community.

## Phylosophy

The purpose of *Evolv-ED* is to be an unbiased platform where the use of all data and software items can be demonstrated to showcase the general necessity of quantitative approches. *Evolv-ED* is firmly devoted to the idea of promoting **reproducibility** in the analysis of evolutionary data, which includes the proper archival of material to ensure their future accessibility and historic utility.

## Team

Currently the project is managed by Adam Kocsis - people interested in contributing are more than welcome to get in touch.
