# Reconstructing multiple points

Understanding how [individual points are reconstructed]({{site.baseurl}}singlepoint) is the basis for reconstructing more complicated data.

To illustrate this, let's reconstruct the approximate past positions of fossil occurrences of the *Glossopteris* genus!


# About *Glossopteris*

Members of the *Glossopteris* (Brongniart, 1831) genus belong in the group of seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta). They were forming forests in the Permian period. The genus got its name from the shape of their leaves (tongue + fern):

*An example from Australia ([Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331462715_Ancient_plants_escaped_the_end-Permian_mass_extinction/figures?lo=1))*

*Fossilized wooden stem ([Source](http://petrifiedwoodmuseum.org/AnatomyGlossopterisStem.htm))*

Eduard Suess noted already in the 19th century that the occurrences of this genus seems to form a pattern, and their sources could be connected geographically (he named this the supercontinent *Gondwanaland*, after Gondwana, an area in India where this seed fern occurs). Later, among other species (such as *Lystrosaurus* and *Mesosaurus*), this has been used a main argument for arguing that some continental plates were connected together:

This genus is also represented in the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/), the largest fossil occurrence database that we have. You can check out the current distribution of these occurrences in the [PBDB-Navigator](https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/).

# Prepared occurrences

Downloading these data and formatting it to be imported to GPlates is somewhat beyond the scope of the tutorial. To make this easier the coordinates are prepared in a compressed zip file. You can download them from [here](download/Glossopteris.zip).

Export the downloaded zip file (in Windows 11, right-click on the file, then Extract All.. and then Extract). There are four files in this zip file:

![](images/multipoint/2.png)

These four files make up the standard ESRI Shapefile format. You need all of them for the data to work.

# Loading the downloaded occurrences

Let's open the PaleoMap rotation file and the corresponding polygons, as in the [previous tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}timerasters/#Other-tectonic-reconstructions):

Use the **Open feature collection** tool to open the .shp file. 

![](images/multipoint/3.png)

Openning this file will open a dialogue box. 

![](images/multipoint/4.png)

Such shapefiles can include lots of additional information, that can be automatically assigned to the imported features. This is not the case now, so feel free to click OK.

![](images/multipoint/5.png)

The occurrence points should show up with the same yellow color.

# Assigning plate IDs

It should not be surpise by now, that if want to change the reconstruction date, the points do not move. 

![](images/multipoint/6.png)

The points do not move because they are not tied to the reconstruction tree, they do not have plate IDs. 
Naturally, you could assign the IDs manually as in the [previous case]({{site.baseurl}}singlepoint), but that is not practical.

Luckily, there is a tool, that works with **all feature collections**. To assign the plate IDs automatically, go to the **Features** / **Assign Plate IDs** menu item!

![](images/multipoint/7.png)

This will open up a dialogue window, where you first have to select the *Partitioning Layer*, i.e. the terrane polygons:

![](images/multipoint/8.png)

... and click **Next**! Then you nee to select the layers to **be partitioned**. This is the occurrences of *Glossopteris*:

![](images/multipoint/9.png)

After that, click **Next**! The next window allows you to fine tune how the plate assignment will happen:

![](images/multipoint/10.png)

For instance, you might want to copy the appeareance and disappearance dates:

![](images/multipoint/11.png)

Then hit **Apply**! Since the reconstruction age in the window is already set to a past date, you can already see that:
- the points changed color
- and are now following the continents.

![](images/multipoint/12.png)

You can move the age slider back to the Permian, and see the original position of the *Glossopteris* fossils!

Now you should know everything to complete your [assignment]({{site.baseurl}}assignment/)!
