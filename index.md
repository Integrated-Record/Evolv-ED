# Welcome to *Evolv-ED!*


*Evolv-ED* is a **prototype online article publishing platform** and **wiki-style** hub for educational material about the computational resources used in evolutionary sciences.

<hr>

There is a growing need for sharing tutorials and step-by-step guides to do research in evolutionary sciences. Scientific activities lead to both infrastructural development and to the increase of the knowledge basis that practicing researchers require to do their craft. This, however is not reflected in the career trajectory of individual scientists. Our time is limited, and early career researchers need to internalize more information than ever before, if they are to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. The purpose of *Evolv-Ed* is to make the acquisition of practical knowledge easier and faster, as well as to facilitate the discovery of resources that can be used to conduct (r)evolutionary research.

<p>
Evolv-ED is a journal candidate and is still in development phase. We are in the process of assessing the viability of the model used for the publication and sustainable use of the platform. 
</p>

<p>
If this initial phase is completed successfully, we will apply for an ISSN number and establish a formal peer-review process.
